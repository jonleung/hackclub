# Workshops

Your one stop shop for workshops. Our workshops are designed to quickly walk
club members through the process of building something, like a website or game,
in a single club meeting.

The workshops are designed for club members to follow independently (so don't
have the club follow a workshop on the projector). We recommend sending out a
link to the workshop(s) using Slack, tlk.io, [Remind](https://www.remind.com/),
or a similar chat service.

## Official Workshops

These are the workshops created and maintained by the hackEDU staff. They are
listed in the order we suggest running them in, though we encourage you to
experiment and improve them (we're always hungry for pull requests).

## Community Workshops

In addition to the workshops that the hackEDU staff make, anyone is encouraged
to create workshops and submit them to the [`contrib`](contrib/) directory. The
community workshops that have been created so far are listed below in
alphabetical order.
